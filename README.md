I am equal parts: engineer, management, and product person; both hands-on and in
leadership.

I've brought products to life from a glimmer of a vision to a team building it, to having
customers, and eventually seeing the product come to an end. I've worked as part of large
and small teams and led them to make impossible things possible.

- 12 years in software engineering.
- 8 years in design and product management experience.

As a multifaceted engineer, designer, and communicator, Iâ€™ve focused on creating,
designing, building, and collaborating with people to bring amazing user experiences to
life across multiple platforms.

- Currently a Rustacean ðŸ¦€ coding in Rust and working on all things TUI & CLI! Along w/
  WASM, WASI, fast and efficient desktop and web apps. Coding in Rust, TypeScript, React,
