âœ¨ You can read all my articles on [developerlife.com](https://developerlife.com) and
watch my videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@developerlifecom).

I am equal parts: engineer, management, and product person; both hands-on and in
leadership. I move fluidly between the realms of desktop, web, mobile, cloud,
infrastructure, server, client.

I've brought products to life from a glimmer of a vision to a team building it, to having
customers, and eventually seeing the product come to an end. I've worked as part of large
and small teams and led them to make impossible things possible.

I have over 30 years of work experience in the tech sector:

- 22 years in software engineering.
- 8 years in executive leadership, design, product management experience.

As a multifaceted entrepreneur, leader, engineer, designer, and communicator, Iâ€™ve focused
on creating, designing, building, and collaborating with people to bring amazing user
experiences to life across multiple platforms.
